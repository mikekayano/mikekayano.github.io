								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic.jpg" alt=""></span>
								<p>Hello! I am a recent CSULB graduate with a BS in Management Information Systems from California State University, Long Beach and an AS in Computer Information Systems from El Camino College, I have also obtained a Google Data Analytics Certificate, issued by Coursera in April 2023.</a></p>
								<p>Throughout my academic journey, I have acquired a diverse range of skills in data analysis and visualization. Proficient in SQL, I have honed my ability to analyze complex datasets, extracting valuable insights through efficient data manipulation. With expertise in both Python and R programming, I am well-equipped to visualize data effectively, utilizing these powerful languages to generate interactive and informative visual representations. Leveraging Tableau, I have developed the capability to create compelling data visualizations that convey complex information in a visually appealing manner. Moreover, my experience with Microsoft Excel extends beyond data analysis, as I have utilized its robust features to visualize data, allowing for clear and concise presentation of insights.</p>
								<p>I am highly interested in pursuing a business or data analyst role due to my passion for data-driven decision-making. I find immense satisfaction in working with data and uncovering insights that can shape strategic business outcomes. With a natural inclination towards problem-solving and analytical thinking, I am drawn to the opportunity of addressing complex challenges and proposing data-driven solutions. By leveraging my skills in data analysis and interpretation, I aim to provide valuable insights to stakeholders and leadership teams, enabling them to make informed decisions that drive growth, optimize operations, and ultimately contribute to the overall success of the organization.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/work.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Currently, I serve as a Technology Professional Intern in the Internal Service Department, contributing to the development of a laptop tracking application that oversees more than 10,000 devices. In this role, I've been involved in various aspects of the project, including gathering system requirements, creating flowcharts, and designing an efficient database for data management. I've also played a crucial role in testing the database by using SQL queries on sample data and provided software support to end-users in a help desk and community-based setting to ensure exceptional service.</p>
								<p>Prior to this, I worked as a Cashier and Boba Tea Maker at Cafe Pruvia, where I actively fostered efficient communication channels within the team, resulting in a smoother and more productive work environment. I also excelled in resolving customer complaints promptly and effectively, ensuring customer satisfaction and maintaining positive relationships. Additionally, I took on the role of mentoring new baristas, offering guidance and training to facilitate their integration into the team and uphold consistent service standards.</p>
								<p>My professional journey also includes the role of Store Manager at Tapioca and Pho, where I achieved a 15% reduction in daily food waste through precise forecasting and ordering practices, leading to significant cost savings and improved sustainability. I utilized sales data analysis to identify popular seasonal menu items and successfully allocated staff resources during peak hours, ultimately improving service and reducing wait times.</p>

								<h2 class="major">COVID-19</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The purpose of this project is to gain insights into the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on diverse countries and populations. I have sourced my data from the Covid Deaths dataset provided by Our World in Data, and am specifically interested in examining statistics related to the number of cases, deaths, and vaccinations across various continents and individual countries. By conducting this analysis, I hope to uncover meaningful insights into the pandemic and how it has affected different regions of the world. </p>
								<h3> Data Exploration in SQL</h3>
								<p> This SQL script analyzes Covid-19 data from the "PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths" table. The script has 13 queries that explore the data in different ways. The first few queries select data from the table, filter it based on specific conditions, and order it by certain columns. The next queries calculate the death percentage and infection rate in different countries and continents. The script also includes queries that show Covid-related data for the United States and global numbers. The last few queries use CTE and temporary tables to perform calculations on the data. Finally, the script creates a view to store the data. </p>

								<h3>Tableau</h3>
								<p>As part of this project, I have developed a visualization in Tableau that provides a comprehensive and interactive breakdown of COVID-19 data into three categories. The first category, total numbers globally, offers a high-level overview of the pandemic's reach worldwide by displaying the total number of cases and deaths recorded globally, along with a continent-wise breakdown of these figures. This information helps to assess the scale and severity of the pandemic on a global level. The second category, total deaths per continent, examines how COVID-19 has impacted individual continents, displaying the total number of deaths recorded in each continent and comparing death rates between them. This helps gain a deeper understanding of how different regions are affected and how they are coping with the crisis. Finally, the third category, percent of the population infected, provides insights into the spread of the pandemic at a population level by displaying the percentage of the population that has been infected in each continent, giving us a sense of the overall impact of the virus on different populations.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Database Design and<br>SQL Utilization</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic001.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In this project, I showcased my expertise in designing a comprehensive database system for McDonald's, emphasizing my skills in ER diagram creation, relational table design, and SQL query formulation. Using MySQL and Visio, I crafted a robust database that reflects the intricate operations of McDonald's, accommodating over 13,000 U.S. restaurants. The project tackled user requirements, encompassing employee roles, customer orders, payments, and product details. The database was realized through a multi-phase approach, starting with a conceptual E-R diagram, followed by logical table design and implementation in MySQL. Query examples demonstrated data retrieval, and I introduced views and stored procedures for efficient data access and analysis. This project underscores my proficiency in transforming complex real-world business scenarios into a structured and efficient database model.</p>
								<h3> Use of SQL</h3>
								<p> In this project, I effectively demonstrated the use of SQL through Joins, Views, and Distinct operations to illustrate the database's functionality and its potential use cases. It's important to note that while the data was manually populated, the primary goal was not to extract actionable insights. Instead, the focus was on showcasing the database's structure and its capacity to manage, retrieve, and manipulate data. This project highlights my proficiency in database management and SQL, essential skills for a data analyst, and underscores my ability to create a robust database system tailored to the specific needs of a business scenario. </p>
